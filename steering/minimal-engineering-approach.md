# Minimal Engineering Approach

## Core Principles

- **Keep it simple**: Write only the minimal code needed to solve the problem
- **One file solutions**: Prefer single-file implementations over complex project structures
- **Fix, don't bypass**: When something isn't working, fix the existing solution first
- **No workarounds**: Don't build workarounds or bypasses unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Essential files only**: Create only necessary files (avoid excessive documentation, config files, or helper scripts)

## File Creation Guidelines

- **Maximum 3-5 files** for most projects
- **One README.md** with essential information only
- **No separate documentation files** unless specifically requested
- **No helper scripts** unless absolutely necessary
- **No excessive configuration files**

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **First**: Try to fix the existing solution
2. **Second**: Modify the current approach minimally
3. **Last resort**: Create alternative solution (only if user requests it)

## Code Guidelines

- Write concise, focused code
- Avoid over-abstraction
- Keep functions small and direct
- Minimize dependencies
- Use built-in solutions when possible

## Documentation

- Keep README concise and practical
- Focus on "how to run" not "how it works"
- Include only essential troubleshooting
- No architectural explanations unless requested
